Add this import at the top of App.tsx (after other imports): import ''./src/i18n'';\n2. This should be placed near the top with other imports, around line 12-13 would be appropriate (after the DownloadProvider import)\n3. No other changes are needed - the import alone will initialize the i18n system due to the side effects in the i18n/index.ts file\n\n**Important:**\n- Just add the import, don''t wrap the component or make other changes\n- The i18n configuration uses useSuspense: false, so no Suspense wrapper is needed\n- Ensure the import path is correct: ''./src/i18n'' (not ''./src/i18n/index.ts'')\n\nReport back with:\n- The exact location where you added the import\n- Confirmation that the file was edited successfully\")",
